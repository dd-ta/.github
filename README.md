### What We Do 🤷‍♂️

- 🔥 **Flame Each Other** - It's not personal, it's just Tuesday
- 📉 **Make Questionable Trades** - Diamond hands or paper hands? Why not both?
- 🚀 **Build Random Stuff** - Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't
- 💎 **HODL Dreams** - To the moon or to the ground, no in-between

   |  TO THE   |
   |   MOON!   |

```

### Our Philosophy 📜

1. **Code First, Ask Questions Later** ⚡
2. **If It Compiles, Ship It** 🚢
3. **Bugs Are Just Undocumented Features** 🐛
4. **YOLO-Driven Development** 🎲

### Current Status 📊

```ascii
Market Portfolio: 📉📉📉 (It's fine, we're fine)
Code Quality:     ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Team Morale:      🔥🔥🔥 (Literally on fire)
Meme Game:        💯💯💯
```

### Tech Stack (When We Remember) 💻

- **Languages**: Whatever works (or doesn't)
- **Framework**: The one that looked cool on Hacker News
- **Database**: MongoDB (because we like chaos)
- **Deployment**: `git push --force` and pray
- **Testing**: Production is our test environment
